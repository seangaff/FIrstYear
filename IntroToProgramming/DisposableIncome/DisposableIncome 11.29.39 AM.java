/*  SELF ASSESSMENT
   1. Did I use appropriate CONSTANTS instead of numbers within the code?
       Mark out of 10: 10  
       Comment: Used a constant to declare the tax rate.
   2. Did I use easy-to-understand, meaningful CONSTANT names?
       Mark out of 5:  5
       Comment: Yes it's easy to understand the constant repersents the tax rate.
    3. Did I format the CONSTANT names properly (in UPPERCASE)?

       Comment: Yes I did format the CONSTANT names properly.
   4. Did I use easy-to-understand meaningful variable names?
       Mark out of 10:  10
       Comment: Every variable name is specific.
   5. Did I format the variable names properly (in lowerCamelCase)?
       Mark out of 10:  10
       Comment: Yes I did format the variable names correctly in lowerCamelCase.
   6. Did I indent the code appropriately?
